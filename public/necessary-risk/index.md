Startups are really hard. Many things need to come together for one to succeed. Your product needs to solve a big enough problem. Customers need to be willing to pay for it. Your sales approach needs to work. You need to convince very talented people that working on your startup is mutually beneficial. When they join they need to keep them happy and engaged. The list goes on. If enough of those things don’t materialize, your startup will fail. 

One way to increase your odds of success is to be very intentional about when to take risks and when to avoid them. Some people think of this as [managing your “innovation tokens”](https://matt-rickard.com/innovation-tokens) or [making boring choices](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology). 

But it’s not always obvious that you’re even taking on risk. 

Let's take an intentionally simplistic example: You have to hire one additional engineer for your early stage startup. Where should your recruiter source candidates from? Here are your only options: 

a. Startups and Big Tech 
b. Big tech only
c. Startups only

Absent any other information about the role, your current team or company, and absent any additional levers for filtering candidates, what would you choose? 

I would choose option 3: only source people who worked at startups. 

It’s not that I think people who worked at Google can’t hack it at startups — _obviously_ they can, and they often do. But I also believe that previous success at a startup is a better predictor of future success at a startup than previous success at big tech, just because it’s a much more direct proof point of success in a similar context. Plus, there are probably enough engineers who were previously successful at startups to fill the role within a reasonable amount of time. I’m sure a huge number of big tech employees could succeed in the role, but given the beliefs above, I don’t gain anything by taking on the additional risk. Therefore, sourcing from big tech introduces unnecessary risk. I can achieve my goal without it. 

Obviously, the example above is simplistic, ridiculous even. If you were hiring for real, you’d know way more about the role, your current team composition, and your team’s specific needs, and you’d have more ability to filter candidates than just using “worked at startups” vs. “worked at big tech”. But at startups, you often have to make decisions with very little information. You constantly have to choose between spending time collecting more information or acting on what you already know. In those situations, you may be able to act quickly by eliminating any unnecessary risk and doing what you already know will work. 

Remember, though, that the other half of this is knowing when you _should_ take on risk. If you only do what you know, you’ll stifle innovation and excessively avoid risk. This can kill a startup by causing it to offer the market nothing new at all. An incumbent can afford not to innovate (for a while), but startups by definition cannot.

The trick is knowing the true level of risk you’re taking on, and which risks are worth it.
