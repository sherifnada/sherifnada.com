Established companies typically have a handbook where they write down information, policies, and processes that most or all people at the company should know. There's a lot of diversity in the contents of handbooks but the most common topics I've seen include: 
- Company mission statement & values 
- Code of conduct & broad expectations of all employees such as working hours, communication norms, methodologies of working, and more
- Organizational principles e.g: around how to prioritize product decisions or how teams should be structured or interact together
- Hiring philosophy and process, including anti-discrimination and diversity & inclusion policies
- Performance management, compensation, raises, and promotion philosophy & process
- Onboarding process for new employees and offboarding process for outgoing employees
- Organizational defaults like default software for employees or default tech stack for the engineering team or the default hiring locations for distributed teams
- Frequently needed HR things like expense policies, benefits, holidays, etc..

It's tempting to think of handbooks as a big company thing, but they're just as useful for startups because they can help them maintain a high [clock speed](https://sriramk.com/clock-speed/). At its core, a handbook is just a highly visible centralized cache of information relevant to everyone in the company. So instead of Slacking each other the same questions over and over, employees can consult the handbook to instantly get answers. This caching aspect also works favorably when information or policies change. For example, if an employee couldn't find an answer about vacation policies in the handbook, it'd be very easy for them to add a sentence or two to the handbook entry on vacation policy once they find the answer. Once they do, everyone now has access to the latest and most comprehensive answer. So a well-organized handbook serves as a look-up table with `O(1)` inserts, updates, and look-up times, thus increasing the whole company's clock speed. 
 
The idea of a handbook isn't new. Plenty of companies have one. Some companies even keep it up to date. 

What seems less common though is companies making their handbooks public. I find this surprising because a public handbook is an excellent tool for branding and improves hiring and retention. Plus, making a handbook public has zero marginal cost. All the hard work is in actually making and maintaining the content of the handbook, not changing its visibility from private to public. If you're worried about the effort that needs to go into creating a polished looking handbook, just remember that you can always publish a public Notion page. That's [what we did at Airbyte](https://handbook.airbyte.com). So making your handbook public is essentially the branding equivalent of free money, if only you would choose to reach for it.

The biggest benefit of a public handbook is the ability to broadcast your culture to prospective candidates. This has some baseline positive benefits like increasing familiarity and trust with your brand since you're being very upfront about how the company operates. But more importantly, it attracts candidates to your company who are already bought into your culture, which improves quality of hiring as well as retention, since people self-selected your culture and know what they're in for when they apply. 

Here's a great example: at the time of writing, [Posthog](posthog.com) had an entry in their [company handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook/world-class-engineering) about how they prioritize work and how it impacts their hiring. Here are some selected quotes that I think do a great job of showcasing their culture: 

>   **[At Posthog, there is] no product management by default**. Engineers decide what to build. 
>  ...
>  In nearly any company, having each engineer decide what to work on would fail. They simply lack enough context. [But] PostHog is exceptionally transparent. 
>  ...
>  **It starts with hiring**. We hire people we think will flourish in an autonomous environment. We often hire people with broader rather than narrower skill sets, who are more flexible. 
>  ...
>  **A high percentage of the company are engineers.** 80% of the company are shipping product. 

I love this part of the handbook because it authentically and unapologetically exhibits what makes Posthog different. Lots of people -- including engineers -- will think it's crazy that engineers are running the roadmap. Those people will probably never apply to work at Posthog, which is a win for both parties. But those who end up applying to work at Posthog probably find this not only okay, but actively exciting. This is also a win-win: employees find a culture that resonates with them, and Posthog hire employees who are more motivated by the environment, productive, and likely to stay longer at the company. From my personal experience as a hiring manager at Airbyte, candidates very frequently cited the handbook as a reason they wanted to work at the company. 

Making your handbook public will also result in a better handbook. Docs have a reputation for going out of date, but if they're public for the world and every single candidate to see, you'll have a pretty big incentive to keep them very updated and polished. 

### Handbooks that influenced my thinking
It's hard to say a whol lot more about this topic other than: if you have a handbook, go make it public ASAP. 

Beyond that, I think the best way to understand the benefits is to see it for yourself. Go read some of the handbooks below and ask yourself how much more certain you'd feel in your decision to apply or not apply to a company after having seen their culture in depth via their handbook vs. a company where you just saw a single job description and maybe some vague values on the careers page. 

Here are some handbooks that influenced how I think about culture and handbooks in general: 

- **[GitLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com)** -- the OG public handbook. Gitlab was one of if not the first tech company to publish their handbook and keep it up to date in public. It's more verbose than what I'd personally do, but it's a must-see if you're interested in this topic. 
- **[Airbyte**](handbook.airbyte.com) -- I was early at Airbyte and saw the handbook evolve with our culture, and I contributed to it as well. I'm biased, but I like that it's generally pretty concise but still informative on a lot of topics
- [**BaseCamp**](https://basecamp.com/handbook) -- I like that BaseCamp creates a
