Hi folks! Thanks for visiting my blog. In case the massive page header didn't give it away, I'm Sherif Nada. 

In this blog, I'll write about engineering management, startups, software engineering, and anything else in between. 


## About me 
Most recently I was founding engineer-turned-engineering-manager at [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com) where I built products and teams responsible for developer tooling, data integrations, and AI data workflows. 

Prior to that, I was a tech lead at [LiveRamp](https://liveramp.com) where I built and maintained petabyte-scale data platforms and pipelines. 

I went to school at Middlebury College where I studied Mathematics and Computer Science and founded Photon, the world&apos;s simplest photo printing service. 

Oh, and in case this kind of thing interests you, I built this blog using NextJS & React as a way to learn what StAtE oF tHe ArT looks like in front-end these days. And boy let me tell you, the state of the art sure is _something_. It's been fun though! You can find the code [here](https://github.com/sherifnada/sherifnada.com).

Enjoy!
