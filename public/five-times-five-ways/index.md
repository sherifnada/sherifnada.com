I was recently talking with a founder who felt that as headcount grew, alignment became harder. It was taking longer for people to internalize new information about the roadmap, process, or company direction.

While not a panacea, one helpful technique I learned from [Brian Leonard](https://twitter.com/bleonard) at Airbyte is: if you want people to really internalize something, you have to say it five times in five different ways. For example, if you set new quarterly goals, you could publish a written doc explaining them, then reiterate them again in the company all-hands, then reiterate them in 1:1s with your reports (and if your reports are managers, ask them to do the same), and so on. 

Beyond those three methods (memos, all-hands, and 1:1s), you typically need to get creative. You might need team-specific workshops or Q&A forums. You could even hang up signs in the office to drill home the message. The sky is the limit. 

When I was at Airbyte (where we built a tool for data transfer), we decided to overhaul how we write data in customer databases. Instead of expanding nested JSON data into multiple tables in the customer database (which was becoming a huge pain point for customers), we wanted each “stream” of data (an API endpoint is a stream of data) to result in a single output table. The project was called “one stream, one table”. A masterful sloganeer, Brian started opening and closing every meeting (regardless of who was attending, or why) by chanting “ONE STREAM! ONE TABLE!” and fist pumping. It was funny, goofy, and _incredibly effective_ at focusing people. He even made t-shirts whose graphic a literal table on top of a literal stream and handed them out to anyone who would take them. 

To the untrained eye, it might have seemed whimsical, but in truth Brian was putting on a masterclass in alignment.
